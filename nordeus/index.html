  <h1>UNDP Selfemployment</h1>

  <div class="content">

  <p>I was contracted by the Macedonian company “GOVe” to work on a tablet-only Android application for UNDP’s Selfemployment project.</p>

  <p>The application is meant to be used by UNDP employees to track the progress of applicants in the system through questionnaires and reports. Think of it as an upgrade from their current, established practices, using paper forms.</p>

  <p>The application’s design needed to be clear and consistent.</p>

  <p>My responisibilities were to design and develop the full front-end solution, as well as aid in the crafting of the back-end solution.</p>

  <p>What follows are screenshots of one of the final versions of the product.</p>

  <p>Some of the most challenging aspects were designing an interface which is clear and consistent, having in mind that the users do not have much experience in using tablets. This is why I decided to expose as much of the native Android patterns as possible, since this will not be the only application they will be using.</p>

      <p>If the device has not yet downloaded the company’s information, this is what they’re greeted with.</p>

      <p>Users need to download a company’s information, since the application will be used in areas which are generally off-line or where broadband access is limited.</p>

      <p>Searching though companies.</p>
      <p>There are multiple ways of searching, initially: name, and by a government employment centre (showed here).</p>
      <p>Later it was established that searching by name is generally more difficult, so functionality was added to search through year-of-establishment. (Not displayed here.)</p>

    <figcaption>
      <p>What happens when the user is editing (and has priviliges to do so).</p>
      <p>An emphasis has been placed on exploiting the native Android UI and UX patterns. For example, back may be used here to cancel the operation.</p>

      <p>Locations: This screen shows and allows interaction with all the locations in the system for a company.</p>
      <p>Oftentimes the UNDP staff live in bigger cities, and the recipients of funds are from rural areas. This feature is aimed at helping UNDP staff better locate their subjects.</p>

  <h1>TAXI Summoning Application</h1>

  <div class="content">

  <p>As a freelance project for a Macedonian company, I was contracted to develop a completely automated application for summoning TAXIs.</p>

  <p>Their TAXI system was already built out and completely built out, I just needed to design and develop the complete mobile application.</p>

  <p>After several redesigns and prototypes, I decided to quit the project. Here’s some of the things I built.</p>

  <h2>Initial Prototype</h2>

  <p>This was the initial prototype, which was used to provide a proof-of-concept to the client.</p>
